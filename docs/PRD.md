# Pige Product Requirements

Status: Active product contract
Baseline date: 2026-07-09
Last reviewed: 2026-07-10

## Repository Reading Boundary (Non-Normative)

This repository is a PRD-only preserved snapshot. The original `Status: Active
product contract`, `Baseline date`, and `Last reviewed` metadata describe the
preserved PRD contract, not current implementation or readiness. `v0.1 Public
Alpha` is the specified product target, not the repository's release status.

The following retained references are historical, unavailable owner references
in this snapshot:

- `docs/START_HERE_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md`
- `resources/traceability/p0-coverage.manifest.json`
- `docs/SPEC_TRACEABILITY.md`
- `docs/V0_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAYBOOK.md`
- `resources/traceability/acceptance.manifest.json`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`

The same availability boundary applies throughout this PRD to all other absent
owner documents, manifests, schemas, tools, tests, build systems, CI workflows,
and release infrastructure. Retained references do not establish their presence,
implementation evidence, or release readiness, or authorize reconstruction. This
note describes repository availability only; it does not change the preserved
requirements, normative language, stable IDs, or P0/P1/P2 scope.

## 0. Contract Authority And AI Use

This PRD is written for AI Coding Agents that implement and maintain Pige. It is a
normative product contract, not a marketing narrative, implementation-status report, or
second copy of specialized technical contracts.

This document owns:

- The product optimization order and default user mental model.
- User-visible behavior, product workflows, degraded behavior, and forbidden behavior.
- `v0.1 Public Alpha` P0 scope, P1/P2 disposition, product acceptance outcomes, and
  product risks.

This document does not own executable types, schemas, internal paths, dependency
versions, model files, parser limits, IPC payloads, storage layouts, or current
implementation evidence. Those facts live in the specialized owner documents and
machine-readable resources routed by `docs/START_HERE_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md`.

Normative language:

- **MUST / MUST NOT**: release-blocking product contract.
- **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT**: required default unless an owner documents a compatible
  reason and verification for another path.
- **MAY**: permitted behavior, not a release requirement by itself.
- Examples and recommendations are non-normative unless a requirement explicitly
  promotes them.

Requirement and evidence ownership:

- The P0 bullets in section 8 are the complete release-scope ledger. Their stable
  `P0-*` identities and requirement coverage are projected by
  `resources/traceability/p0-coverage.manifest.json`.
- Stable `PIGE-*` requirements and their owner, phase, milestone, and verification
  class are registered in `docs/SPEC_TRACEABILITY.md`.
- Phase order and Build/Exit gates are owned by
  `docs/V0_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAYBOOK.md`; they do not redefine product scope.
- Current status and evidence are owned by
  `resources/traceability/acceptance.manifest.json`; current implementation notes MUST
  NOT be maintained in this PRD.

Changes to this contract follow the bidirectional PRD-impact rule in `AGENTS.md` and the
classification/propagation procedure in `docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.

For every requirement, an implementing Agent must be able to determine the product
intent, trigger or precondition, required observable behavior, degraded or blocked
behavior, forbidden behavior, user-visible completion evidence, specialized owners,
and verification path. A section may state those facts directly or reference their
single owner; it must not create a competing technical definition.

## 1. Summary

Pige is a local-first general-purpose personal Agent. One Home conversation accepts
ordinary questions, tasks, sources, and files. Local knowledge strengthens a turn when
relevant; it is not required for an Agent response. Useful material can become an
interlinked Markdown wiki or typed Dataset owned by the user. **Input once, knowledge
grows naturally:**
normal validated reversible knowledge work is autonomous by default.

The product combines three familiar metaphors:

- Flomo-like lightweight capture.
- ChatGPT-like conversational input.
- Open local vault for narrative and structured knowledge.

Unlike ordinary assistants, Pige can compile useful work into durable Markdown or
Dataset knowledge and use it in later conversations.

## 2. Product Positioning

One-line positioning:

> Pige is a general Agent grounded in the personal knowledge you choose to keep.

This is the long-term positioning, not permission to claim unsupported v0.1 formats.
Sections 8–10 own the accepted release inputs and degraded behavior.

Short positioning:

> Ask anything. When your knowledge matters, Pige retrieves and cites it; when something
> is worth keeping, Pige can turn it into portable local knowledge.

Product contrast:

- Not a manual folder/tag note app.
- Not a knowledge-only RAG chatbot over uploaded files.
- Not a cloud-first AI knowledge base.
- Not an Obsidian clone with AI features bolted on.
- Not a developer-facing Agent runtime console.

Pige's center of gravity is Pi Agent; personal knowledge is its durable memory and
distinctive toolset, not the limit of what users may ask.

## 3. Problem

People save articles, documents, snippets, ideas, meeting notes, and references across too many tools. Manual organization breaks down because every capture requires decisions: title, folder, tag, format, backlink, summary, and future retrieval path.

AI note tools often solve only the answer layer. They let users ask questions over a pile of documents, but they do not create a durable knowledge artifact. The same synthesis gets re-derived in chat again and again.

Pige solves the maintenance burden:

- Users should not decide where every note belongs before capturing it.
- Sources should remain preserved and inspectable.
- Useful knowledge should become Markdown pages, not disappear into chat history.
- Cross-links, tags, summaries, conflicts, and indexes should be maintained by the Agent.

## 4. Target Users

Primary users:

- Researchers, builders, writers, founders, analysts, and students who collect many sources over time.
- Users who like local Markdown ownership but do not enjoy manual knowledge-base maintenance.
- Users who want BYOK AI tools and do not want their knowledge base locked into one cloud provider.

Secondary or future users that do not define the v0.1 default experience:

- Teams that may later want a shared local-first or Git-backed knowledge base.
- Power users who already use Obsidian, Logseq, VS Code, or Git.

## 5. Product Optimization Order

When product requirements compete, AI Coding Agents MUST resolve them in the following
order. A lower group cannot weaken a higher group merely to simplify implementation.

### 5.1 Preserve Data, Ownership, And Trust

1. Captures and durable user data MUST survive parser, model, dependency, cancellation,
   crash, and restart failures. Recovery beats completing an uncertain automation.
2. Markdown remains narrative truth and versioned Dataset Bundles are structured truth;
   internal databases, indexes, thumbnails, embeddings, and caches remain rebuildable.
3. Original files remain user-owned. Pige may make a managed copy or retain a verified
   reference according to the source-storage contract, but MUST NOT force migration,
   silently rewrite evidence, or treat a future link strategy as a v0.1 strategy.
4. Agent changes MUST be visible, attributable, recoverable, and operation-recorded.
   Human intervention is reserved for irreversible/destructive action, security or
   authority escalation, a new/changed external destination, unresolved conflict, or an
   explicit stricter user policy.
5. Ingested content is untrusted and MUST NOT change user intent, product policy,
   settings, tools, schemas, or permission boundaries.
6. Durable truth, regenerable artifacts, machine-local preferences, secrets, caches,
   and temporary state MUST remain distinguishable. Large source bodies and saved page
   bodies MUST NOT be duplicated into conversation history.

### 5.2 Keep The Default Product Simple And Useful

1. The default experience is Agent-first: one calm Home composer accepts conversation,
   tasks, knowledge, and sources without a mode choice.
2. Every submission enters Pi. Product services may preserve evidence first and enforce
   safety, but cannot infer semantic intent with punctuation, URL, MIME, or file rules.
3. The Agent autonomously maintains naming, linking, filing, summaries, and structure.
   Users guide, inspect, correct, or undo outcomes; they do not supervise each step.
4. Ordinary answers may remain conversational; reusable outcomes can become Markdown or
   a Dataset revision/view.
5. When local knowledge is relevant, retrieval returns grounded synthesis plus ranked,
   inspectable notes. Empty or irrelevant retrieval does not block ordinary conversation.
6. The interface MUST be keyboard usable, screen-reader understandable, contrast-safe,
   IME-safe, and usable with larger text. Simplicity cannot depend on tiny controls or
   visual-only cues.

### 5.3 Hide Runtime Complexity Behind Effective Defaults

1. BYOK is available from the first release. One provider and one default model are
   enough; after one boundary disclosure, routine bounded calls to that selected
   destination run without repeated prompts and use calm status instead.
2. Agent-affecting settings compile into typed runtime policy and are enforced by the
   owning services; prompt text alone is not enforcement.
3. Retrieval indexes, embeddings, and reranking run locally by default. Missing optional
   model assets degrade to a usable local fallback instead of blocking capture.
4. Speech and OCR prefer high-quality on-device platform capabilities. Optional local
   downloads are explicit; ordinary work never performs hidden task-time dependency
   installation.
5. The core toolchain is available or visibly repairable before a dependent workflow
   runs. Exact tools, versions, model files, and packaging choices are owned outside this
   PRD.
6. Agent memory remains distinct from the wiki: local, inspectable, scoped, reversible,
   provenance-linked, and never treated as unsupported factual evidence.

### 5.4 Extend Vertically Without Turning Pige Into A Platform Console

1. Default Skills and packages strengthen the core Agent or personal-knowledge loop;
   broader user-directed tools remain permissioned and progressively disclosed.
2. Extension installation is explicit, staged, reversible, capability-declared, and
   permission-mediated. Source content and model output cannot install or enable an
   extension.
3. Internationalization and multilingual knowledge are part of v0.1; language behavior
   is explicit rather than inferred from one global locale.
4. Backup and restore precede sync. Cloud sync, Web, mobile clients, and remote Agent
   execution are later products, while v0.1 contracts remain portable enough to avoid a
   forced rewrite.

## 6. Default User Model And Product Concepts

Default user model:

- The primary v0.1 user is an individual who repeatedly captures text, links, and
  documents, values local ownership, and wants useful knowledge without manually
  maintaining folders, tags, backlinks, or an AI toolchain.
- The user understands ordinary product concepts such as local notes, original files,
  sources, search results, model provider, permission, backup, and restore.
- The default UI MUST NOT require the user to understand Source Records, Artifacts,
  Jobs, RAG, embeddings, runtime adapters, schemas, package types, or provider taxonomy.
- Teams, shared vaults, remote Agent execution, and broad automation are outside the
  v0.1 user model even when the underlying contracts reserve a future path.

Default product loop:

```text
submit one Home turn and create one Agent Job
-> preserve source-bearing evidence as that Job's first checkpoint
-> Pi interprets intent and chooses bounded tools
-> answer, clarify, or show durable/paused/review outcomes
```

The concepts below exist to make that loop deterministic for implementation. Internal
names may appear in diagnostics or advanced inspection, but the default product copy
uses the user-facing language owned by `docs/UI_PROTOTYPE.md` and
`docs/I18N_DESIGN.md`.

### 6.1 Home Composer

The Home Composer is the user's only required interaction surface. It accepts ordinary
conversation, tasks, knowledge requests, and source-bearing inputs:

- Typed or pasted text.
- Natural language questions.
- Voice dictation on supported macOS versions.
- Markdown or plain text files.
- Web links.
- PDF, Word, and PowerPoint files.
- Images and screenshots with OCR.
- Bounded whole-window multi-file drops submit one ordered Agent turn.

File gestures have one visible distinction. Releasing a whole-window drop immediately
submits those files as one Agent turn. Choosing files from the composer attachment picker
only stages removable local chips; it creates no Job, source, conversation event, model
call, or network work until Send or a valid Enter. Submit atomically binds the exact
authored query and staged attachments to one Agent turn and one parent Job. Attachment-
only submit adds only the minimal organize intent. A rejected submit preserves the exact
query and chips; idempotent retry cannot duplicate the turn or source preservation. A
failed drop keeps its order/turn identity for explicit retry without consuming the draft.

Paste uses the same submit boundary. Exact clipboard text remains ordinary composer text
only when insertion keeps the composer within 8,000 Unicode code points, without trim or
normalization. Otherwise the whole clipboard payload becomes one removable large-paste
item and existing composer text stays unchanged. Files and large pastes share one ordered
staged-item list; selection, staging and removal remain side-effect free. Send snapshots
the exact query and ordered list, preserves each accepted paste once as a managed source,
and stores conversation references rather than duplicate bodies. The canonical counts,
byte bounds and retry rules live in `resources/large-paste-boundary.manifest.json`.

The home timeline should show recent captures, retrieved answers, job progress, and Agent summaries. Durable knowledge belongs in Markdown pages, source pages, `index.md`, and `log.md`.

Default home requirements:

- The first screen should be dominated by a single bottom composer.
- The user should not need to choose a type, folder, tag, capture mode, or ask mode before typing.
- The composer should not expose user-selectable "deep organize", "smart search",
  capture, ask, or retrieval modes. Pi decides whether to answer, clarify, retrieve,
  preserve, organize, or use another bounded tool.
- The whole window should become a drop target when files are dragged over it.
- Empty state should be calm and sparse, with minimal chrome.
- Advanced navigation should be hidden behind progressive disclosure.
- Host or renderer code must not route by question marks, text shape, URL detection,
  attachment presence, MIME, or source kind. Explicit user instructions may constrain Pi.
- If local knowledge is relevant, Pi prefers bounded local retrieval and cites what it
  uses. Otherwise it answers normally without fabricated local citations.
- Model-backed answers replace a safe provisional draft in place while Pi works; the
  durable upstream Pi final is authoritative. Known citation metadata appears only then.
- Voice input should be available from the composer toolbar as a low-friction alternative to typing.

#### 6.1.1 Window And Layout Modes

Pige should support distinct window modes because capture and reading have different ergonomics.

Default compact mode:

- Narrow vertical window optimized as the daily home entry point.
- Suitable as a side-window next to a browser, PDF reader, editor, meeting app, or chat app.
- Sidebar hidden by default.
- Whole-window drag-and-drop remains active.
- Optional always-on-top toggle so the user can keep Pige available during multi-window work.
- Always-on-top should be user-controlled and visually indicated when active.

Expanded mode:

- Wider window with sidebar and Library available.
- Used for continuing the home dialogue, browsing notes, inspecting sources, and confirming Agent proposals when needed.
- Home composer remains accessible but no longer dominates the whole interface.

Reading/full-screen mode:

- Full-screen or large-window layout optimized for Markdown reading.
- Uses a comfortable centered reading column, not stretched full-width prose.
- Can show navigation, related notes, sources, backlinks, and the Note Agent as side rails when width allows.
- Lets the user hide side rails for distraction-free reading.
- Preserves quick access to Home and current-note Agent actions.

Layout mode is part of the product experience, not just responsive CSS. The app should remember the user's preferred compact size, expanded size, full-screen state, and always-on-top preference per machine.

### 6.2 Source Record And Source Asset

A source record is Pige's durable provenance record for an input. A source asset is the
original evidence or Pige-managed copy used by parsers and citations. Extracted text,
rendered pages, thumbnails, and OCR output are derived artifacts, not original evidence.

A user-selected local `.zip` is one preserved Archive Source and one Source Page. Pige may
show a bounded safe inventory, but never automatically extracts, recursively imports, or
executes an archive member.

v0.1 supports exactly two source-storage outcomes:

- Pige makes a managed copy when the input has no independently owned durable original
  or when the selected strategy requires a stable managed source.
- Pige retains a verified reference to an original file that remains in the user's
  location.

Referenced or managed Markdown, TXT, PDF, DOCX, and PPTX sources may be refreshed only
through Check for updates, a bounded pathless preview, and explicit confirmation. The
confirmation rechecks the immutable candidate before publishing; if an edited Source
Page conflicts, Pige preserves that page and refreshes only the authoritative source
evidence and derived artifacts.

A filesystem link is not a v0.1 storage strategy. The user-visible `source asset root`
setting is the compatibility name for the managed-copy location; it is independently
configurable from the knowledge root. Derived artifacts remain under the portable
artifact root owned by the vault in v0.1 and MUST NOT silently follow an external
managed-copy root.

The executable strategies, root bindings, locators, unavailable-original behavior,
backup implications, and future link exploration are owned by
`docs/SOURCE_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md`, `docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the shared schemas.

#### 6.2.1 Extracted Artifact

An extracted artifact is bounded parser or OCR output created from a source asset. It
may be regenerated when parsers improve, while the source evidence remains unchanged.
Artifact types, storage paths, checksums, locators, and parser/OCR sidecars are owned by
`docs/PARSER_INGEST_SPEC.md` and `docs/SOURCE_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md`.

### 6.3 Compiled Wiki

The compiled wiki is the Agent-maintained Markdown layer. It contains source summaries, normal notes, topic pages, concept pages, entity pages, claims, questions, indexes, and logs.

#### 6.3.1 Knowledge Model And Linking

Pige's knowledge organization is Agent-maintained and Markdown-first. Tags, topics, concepts, entities, claims, questions, backlinks, source citations, and Knowledge Tree relationships are governed by `docs/KNOWLEDGE_MODEL_AND_LINKING.md`.

User-facing simplicity rule:

- Users should not have to choose tags, folders, topics, or relation types before capture.
- Tags are lightweight facets, not the main hierarchy.
- Topics, concepts, entities, claims, and questions are durable Markdown pages when they matter.
- Graph indexes and Knowledge Tree aggregates are rebuildable working layers, not hidden knowledge truth.
- Evidence-bound, reversible graph changes may auto-apply with Operations; only the
  exceptional intervention boundary in section 11.5 pauses.

### 6.4 Schema

The schema is a local instruction file named `PIGE.md`, stored in the vault. It tells the Agent how to maintain the wiki: naming rules, frontmatter rules, page types, link conventions, ingest workflow, query workflow, and lint workflow.

The implementation contract for frontmatter, page types, citations, managed blocks, and `PIGE.md` lives in `docs/MARKDOWN_SCHEMA.md`.

### 6.5 Knowledge Health

Knowledge health is the quality of the wiki as a maintained system:

- Are important pages linked?
- Are claims sourced?
- Are there contradictions?
- Are there stale pages?
- Are tags coherent?
- Are orphan pages intentional?

An exact duplicate-topic candidate may offer a user-chosen two-topic merge. Pige keeps the
selected survivor, moves the absorbed topic to recoverable private trash, and records one
reversible Operation. Ambiguous or stale candidates remain report-only and never rewrite pages.

### 6.6 Processing Status

Processing status covers queued, active, failed, partial, and exceptional intervention jobs.

This capability is important because the user should never lose a capture just because parsing, model calls, or wiki compilation failed.

The detailed lifecycle for durable jobs, checkpoints, retry, cancellation, confirmation proposals, operation records, compaction, and crash recovery lives in `docs/JOB_OPERATION_AND_RECOVERY.md`.

UI rule:

- Do not expose "Inbox" as a default first-level navigation item.
- Show processing status inside Home as activity rows, compact status cards, or notifications.
- A deeper job-management view may exist behind status cards or Settings for troubleshooting.

### 6.7 Exceptional Intervention

Routine work never enters review. Only irreversible loss, authority/security escalation,
destination drift, destructive migration/restore, unresolved conflict, or an explicit
stricter user policy creates a durable
proposal. Breadth, merge/rename, or low confidence instead narrows, preserves, warns, or
abstains. Home shows Activity/Undo and a focused exception, never a Review destination.
Lifecycle is owned by `docs/JOB_OPERATION_AND_RECOVERY.md`.

### 6.8 Home Knowledge Retrieval

Home knowledge retrieval is an Agent-selected enhancement inside ordinary conversation.
It combines local search, ranking, and grounded summarization when personal knowledge is
relevant or the user explicitly asks about the vault.

When selected, it should:

- Interpret a natural language question.
- Find highly relevant notes, source pages, topics, and entities through local hybrid retrieval.
- Show ranked results with snippets and why they matched.
- Produce a short synthesis grounded in those results.
- Let the user open the original Markdown page or source page immediately.
- Let useful answers be saved back into the wiki when the user chooses.

Retrieval stays local even when synthesis is cloud-hosted; only selected context crosses
the configured boundary. Empty or irrelevant results permit an ordinary answer without
local citations. An explicit vault-only request reports insufficient evidence honestly.
Context selection and citation rules are governed by
`docs/CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_AND_RETRIEVAL_POLICY.md`.

UI rule:

- Do not create a separate default "Ask" or "Search" navigation entry in v0.1.
- Full search views can exist as expanded result states from Home, not as a competing primary entry.

### 6.9 Note Agent

The Note Agent is a contextual Agent panel attached to an opened note.

It should help the user interact with the current note without losing reading context:

- Ask questions about the current note.
- Explain a selected passage.
- Find related notes.
- Suggest backlinks.
- Summarize or restructure the note.
- Apply eligible reversible edits with Activity/Undo; preview only an exceptional boundary.

### 6.10 Selection Actions

Selection actions are lightweight commands shown when the user selects text in a note.

Examples:

- Copy.
- Quote into capture.
- Translate.
- Polish.
- Expand.
- Shorten.
- Summarize.
- Explain.
- Create note from selection.
- Ask Agent about selection.

Read-only actions may return inline results. Eligible mutations auto-apply with Activity/Undo; exceptional boundaries preview.

### 6.11 Bundled Toolchain And Local Tool Manager

The bundled toolchain makes supported knowledge workflows available without asking the
Agent or user to improvise dependency installation during a job. Local Capabilities
makes readiness, optional downloads, repair, and local/cloud boundaries visible without
becoming a general tool marketplace. Normative product behavior is in section 16;
technical identity and packaging are owned by Technical Architecture, Release
Engineering, and the dependency manifests.

#### 6.11.1 Local Database

The local database exists to make search, Library, links, jobs, retrieval, and memory
fast. It is never the only copy of knowledge; deleting or rebuilding it can degrade
speed and derived views but cannot delete Markdown or source evidence. Its complete
contract is owned by Local Database Design, Technical Architecture, and Data
Architecture.

### 6.12 Local RAG Pack

The Local RAG Pack is Pige's built-in local retrieval substrate. It hides embedding,
indexing, and reranking setup behind product defaults, keeps lexical search usable when
optional assets are absent, and sends only selected cited context for cloud synthesis.
Normative product behavior is in section 14; runtime, storage, context, and performance
details remain in their specialized owners.

### 6.13 Agent Memory

Agent Memory is distinct from the compiled wiki:

- The wiki is the user's knowledge artifact.
- RAG retrieves notes, sources, and extracted artifacts.
- Agent Memory guides future behavior using local, provenance-linked preferences,
  corrections, and workflow lessons.
- Memory can help interpret intent, but it should not be treated as external evidence unless the user explicitly asks about memory itself.

Normative user controls are in section 15. Memory layers, files, provenance, recall,
indexes, prompt injection, and conversation relationships remain in Agent Memory Design,
Data Architecture, and Context Assembly.

### 6.14 Skill Manager

Skill Manager lets a user explicitly stage, inspect, enable, disable, update, export, and
uninstall repeatable personal-knowledge workflows. It never turns ambiguous capture
into a silent install. Normative product behavior is in section 17; formats, metadata,
storage, capability vocabulary, and security boundaries remain in their specialized
owners.

### 6.15 Internationalization

Pige separates app language from content language. v0.1 UI locales:

- `zh-Hans`: 简体中文.
- `en`: English.
- `ja`: 日本語.
- `ko`: 한국어.
- `fr`: Français.
- `de`: Deutsch.

The UI locale, source language, generated knowledge language, query language, OCR hints,
and dictation language are distinct concepts. The default experience preserves source
language and answers in the query language when possible. Exact locale catalogs,
metadata, fallback, formatting, IME, CJK retrieval, OCR, and speech rules are owned by
`docs/I18N_DESIGN.md`.

### 6.16 Pi Package Manager

Pi Package Manager is a deliberately narrow extension surface for packages that improve
personal knowledge workflows. Curated recommendations precede advanced community
search; the default product never resembles a general Agent marketplace. Normative
product behavior is in section 18; package metadata, trust, lifecycle, write mediation,
and permissions remain in their specialized owners.

### 6.17 Vault Runtime Semantics

Pige's vault is a normal local folder. The first run and Settings let the user create or
open a compatible vault, see where notes and managed source copies live, reveal the
vault in the system file manager, and switch recent vaults without deleting files.

v0.1 product rules:

- One vault path has at most one active Pige window; simultaneous multi-vault work is
  outside v0.1.
- The active path is a machine-local preference, not portable vault identity.
- The Vault display name is portable manifest metadata. Renaming it never changes the
  stable Vault ID or filesystem path and commits only against the exact current metadata
  revision.
- External Markdown changes are never silently overwritten; a conflict becomes a
  visible proposal.
- Agent actions never rewrite source evidence. Deletion is explicit and trash-first.
- Switching vaults pauses or closes current work safely before services reopen.
- Moving a vault is not a simple inline setting in v0.1. The supported path is to reveal,
  move with the operating system, and open the compatible folder, or restore into a new
  folder.
- Index/database repair is visibly separate from durable knowledge storage and cannot
  delete Markdown or Dataset Bundles.

Default paths, root identity, settings fields, atomic writes, external-change detection,
job compaction, durable/rebuildable inventories, backup behavior, and migration safety
are owned by `docs/ONBOARDING_AND_FIRST_RUN.md`, `docs/SETTINGS_AND_PREFERENCES.md`,
`docs/SOURCE_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md`, `docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
`docs/SYNC_CONFLICT_AND_MIGRATION.md`.

### 6.18 Accessibility

v0.1 accessibility baseline:

- All primary actions are keyboard reachable.
- Focus states are visible.
- Icon-only buttons have accessible labels and tooltips.
- Home composer, home retrieval results, note reader, settings, and confirmation flows support keyboard navigation.
- UI does not rely on color alone for status.
- Core UI text contrast meets WCAG AA targets.
- App respects OS reduced-motion settings.
- App remains usable at larger system text sizes.
- Error and progress messages are screen-reader understandable.

## 7. Core User Jobs And Observable State Contract

The following jobs define why the capabilities exist. They are decision inputs for AI
Coding Agents, not separate feature backlogs.

| User trigger | Required product outcome | Primary requirement refs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paste a useful article URL. | Preserve the source, extract readable content, create a source-backed Markdown result, and connect useful knowledge without asking for a folder first. | `PIGE-CAP-001`, `PIGE-INGEST-003`, `PIGE-KNOW-006` |
| Capture a messy idea. | Preserve it immediately and produce a readable titled note when a model is available. | `PIGE-CAP-001`, `PIGE-KNOW-006` |
| Drop a PDF, document, screenshot, or scanned page. | Preserve the input, recover useful text and evidence locators with the best available local parser/OCR path, and expose any partial result or warning. | `PIGE-INGEST-003`, `PIGE-INGEST-004` |
| Drop a CSV, workbook, or supported database snapshot. | Preserve the original, create a lossless typed Dataset when Pi chooses structured import, and answer through bounded local queries with exact citations. | `PIGE-DATA-001`, `PIGE-DATA-002` |
| Ask a general question or work through a task. | Answer normally; if personal knowledge is relevant, retrieve it locally and expose citations. | `PIGE-PI-001`, `PIGE-SEARCH-001`, `PIGE-CONTEXT-001` |
| Open or select text in a note. | Support reading, contextual questions, and reversible transformations without losing the note or its sources. | `PIGE-UI-001`, `PIGE-UI-005`, `PIGE-UI-006` |
| Correct Pige or explicitly ask it to remember a preference. | Apply the current correction, and keep any durable memory local, inspectable, scoped, and reversible. | `PIGE-MEM-001` |
| Inspect a growing vault. | Find broken links, weak provenance, duplicate-topic candidates, stale knowledge, and missing connections without silently reshaping the wiki. | `PIGE-KNOW-005` |
| Move or recover the knowledge base. | Back up and restore durable knowledge and evidence into a fresh folder, then rebuild derived search state. | `PIGE-BACKUP-001`, `PIGE-BACKUP-002`, `PIGE-BACKUP-003`, `PIGE-BACKUP-004` |

User-visible processing states:

| Product state | User-visible contract |
| --- | --- |
| Ready | Home accepts conversation and sources without a mode or taxonomy; model-dependent work waits clearly when no model is ready. |
| Saved locally | The durable source record/reference exists before parser or model work starts. |
| Organizing | Bounded parser, OCR, retrieval, or Agent work is active and progress is visible. |
| Complete | The UI distinguishes what was created, updated, skipped, or warned and links to durable results. |
| Needs intervention | An exceptional boundary names why recovery/undo is insufficient and asks for one decision. |
| Paused; source safe | A dependency, permission, unsupported capability, or recoverable failure blocks further work, but the input remains preserved and a single repair/resume action is available. |

State rules:

- Capture preservation MUST precede parsing, OCR, model calls, retrieval synthesis, and
  wiki compilation.
- Retry, resume, crash recovery, and model configuration MUST NOT duplicate sources,
  conversations, pages, proposals, or applied operations.
- Source-bearing evidence is preserved before expensive work. Ambiguity is resolved by
  Pi through normal conversation, not a hidden host classifier; only exceptional intent
  uses typed intervention or external permission boundaries.
- User-facing state names are product copy, not a competing executable Job vocabulary.
  Their mapping to durable states and repair actions is owned by
  `docs/JOB_OPERATION_AND_RECOVERY.md` and `docs/API_AND_IPC_DESIGN.md`.

## 8. v0.1 Public Alpha Scope

Scope interpretation:

- P0 is the release-level acceptance scope for `v0.1 Public Alpha`, not the implementation scope for a single task, PR, AI session, or phase.
- Implementation must follow `docs/MILESTONES.md` and `docs/V0_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAYBOOK.md`, building vertical slices that preserve data safety and user-visible usefulness at each step.
- A feature may appear in P0 while still being scheduled for a later implementation phase. Future agents must not treat the whole P0 list as one work item.
- Any task that moves a P0 item to P1/P2, or promotes P1/P2 into P0, must update PRD, Milestones, Playbook, Spec Traceability, and Decision Log together.

### 8.1 P0 Must Have

Home and capture:

- Chat-like bottom home composer.
- Default empty state with only the essential home composer visible.
- Home supports ordinary Agent conversation, source capture, and knowledge-enhanced
  requests, including turns with no relevant local evidence.
- Home exposes no mode chips; Pi handles intent and clarification.
- Whole-window drag-and-drop hot zone whose release immediately submits one Agent turn;
  composer-picked files remain local staged attachments until explicit Send.
- On-device voice input on supported macOS 26-or-later systems.
- Plain text capture.
- Markdown and plain text file ingest.
- Web URL ingest with a preserved readable local snapshot and visible bounded-failure behavior.
- PDF ingest through local semantic conversion.
- Word `.docx` ingest through local semantic conversion.
- PowerPoint `.pptx` ingest through local semantic conversion.
- Image and screenshot ingest with OCR where a supported local engine is available.
- OCR fallback for image-heavy PDF pages and selected visual-only PowerPoint slide content.
- Local tool manager for explicitly installing and managing a supported optional OCR fallback.
- Processing status visible in the home timeline.
- Status states for queued, processing, failed, and exceptional intervention captures.
- CSV, XLSX, and supported local database snapshot ingest into a preserved, versioned
  Dataset with typed local query and exact row/range/aggregate citations.

Agent output:

- Title generation.
- Summary.
- Tags.
- Category/topic suggestion.
- Key entities.
- Related note suggestions.
- Markdown page generation.
- Source summary page generation.
- Basic index update.
- Append-only log update.
- Source references with enough detail to trace claims back to source files, URLs, pages, or text spans.
- Change summary that separates created, updated, linked, skipped, failed, and needs-attention actions.

Vault:

- User-selected local knowledge root folder.
- Independently configurable managed-copy location for source copies and web snapshots; derived artifacts remain portable with the vault.
- Default vault path per platform.
- Open durable knowledge storage: Markdown for narrative knowledge and Dataset Bundles
  for structured knowledge.
- Managed source copies remain durable and resolvable under the selected managed-copy location.
- Extracted parser and OCR artifacts remain durable, portable, and regenerable without changing source evidence.
- Markdown source pages remain part of the portable knowledge root.
- Compiled knowledge pages remain part of the portable knowledge root.
- User-visible media remains portable with the knowledge that references it.
- Vault-scoped Agent memory remains inspectable and follows the vault backup policy.
- Complete chat history remains reference-based and portable without duplicating large bodies.
- Vault-scoped Pige Skills remain inspectable and portable.
- Local database files remain rebuildable working state rather than knowledge truth.
- Pige-managed deletion and archive remain recoverable through trash-first lifecycle rules.
- `index.md`, `log.md`, and `PIGE.md`.
- Stable YAML frontmatter plus vault-v2 durable-domain/language compatibility: v1 migrates
  only after preview/backup; language is canonical BCP 47 or `unknown`, never guessed.
- Atomic write and external-change conflict handling for Markdown pages.
- Archive/trash-first deletion policy.
- Stable IDs and conflict metadata prepared for future sync.
- Runtime capability boundaries prepared for future mobile apps and optional cloud/self-hosted Agent execution.

Scale and platform:

- Design target: 10,000 notes/source pages, 100 GB vault, and 100,000 retrieval chunks.
- Minimum v0.1 platform: macOS 26 or later.
- Phase 1 `v0.1 Public Alpha` qualifies macOS 26+ only; Windows 11/10 code, CI and
  packageability remain while public qualification moves to the next platform phase.
- Linux is deferred from v0.1.
- Core installer meets the release size ceiling without bundling optional model/OCR
  downloads.

Navigation:

- Collapsible sidebar.
- Home as the single default input and knowledge-retrieval surface.
- Processing, autonomous Activity/Undo, and exceptional intervention surfaced from Home.
- Library view with an Agent-maintained note tree plus notes, sources, topics, and tags.
- Expanded sidebar should expose the Library tree directly, including at least three levels of hierarchy when available, so browsing does not require a separate Library page first.
- Knowledge Tree as a semantic tree of domains, topics, concepts, sources, fragments, and backlinks, distinct from the Library's category/folder tree.
- Knowledge Tree visual encoding: trunk thickness represents domain weight, branch thickness represents topic weight, leaf count/size/color depth represents fragmented knowledge quantity and density.
- Home knowledge retrieval with ranked results and grounded synthesis.
- Note reader with source metadata and related pages; Reader/Library can correct active-note
  tags/topics, explicitly confirm removal of one existing tag, rename the note, and manage bounded
  aliases without changing stable identity. Closed mutations retain the current Reader/draft, while
  successful changes remain undoable.
- Note Agent side panel.
- Selection actions in note content.
- Skill Manager for pure Skills and capability-declared external/Web Skills.
- Curated Pi Package Manager for reviewed package install, disable, uninstall, and update flows.
- Ordinary bounded work does not prompt. Ask Every Time, scoped grants, or explicit YOLO
  mediate sensitive effects; YOLO suppresses eligible Shell/write/network/install prompts.
  Validation/audit always run, and permanent loss, original overwrite, raw credentials,
  risky edits, protected authority, OS/SSRF/signature/path safety remain hard boundaries.
- Attachment, source, model, and tool content never grants ambient authority; only explicit
  user-authored intent may request a separately confirmed or reviewed ambient capability.
- Settings IA grouped as Basic, Knowledge Base, AI, Security, Extensions, and System.
- Setting ownership, scope, storage, backup behavior, permission requirement, and apply behavior are governed by `docs/SETTINGS_AND_PREFERENCES.md`.
- Knowledge Base settings must include a real Vault & Note Storage page for local note storage: current vault name with a path-independent rename action, active vault path, knowledge root path, managed source-copy path (the v1 UI compatibility label is Source asset root), default source storage strategy, reveal in file manager, exact reconnect for unavailable referenced originals, explicit safe relocation that preserves the original Vault, open existing vault folder, create new vault, recent vaults, backup, restore, trash policy, and safe index repair entry points. Reconnect accepts only the same content and format against current Main-owned proof, preserves the Source ID, and leaves the current record unchanged on cancel, mismatch, or stale state.
- Models settings contain BYOK provider details, model list status, and one default Pi Agent model. Advanced/Fast model assignment is not a v0.1 visible setting unless a real Pi-compatible routing layer exists.
- Local Capabilities settings contain local RAG, embeddings/reranking downloads, OCR, speech input, document parsers, and bundled toolchain health.
- Permissions & Privacy settings contain API key storage, exact connected-Provider send
  disclosure, one calm permission-mode control, visible/revocable scoped grants, explicit
  YOLO status, and the immutable hard-boundary disclosure. It has no content-redaction
  setting or per-tool capability console.
- Skills and Pi Packages live under Extensions, not under Models.

Internationalization:

- UI localization for Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, French, and German.
- System locale default with Settings override.
- Language metadata for captured sources, generated pages, OCR artifacts, chunks, and memory records where useful.
- Home knowledge retrieval can accept and answer in the user's query language.
- Source language is preserved by default.
- CJK-friendly lexical search fallback plus multilingual semantic retrieval through Local RAG.

Accessibility:

- Keyboard reachable primary flows.
- Visible focus states.
- Accessible labels for icon buttons.
- Contrast-safe status and error states.
- Reduced-motion support.

Models:

- BYOK with reviewed Provider templates and a progressively disclosed Custom Provider.
- Templates fill protocol/Endpoint; Custom alone exposes three compatible protocols and Base URL.
- Connect auto-syncs one Provider inventory; manual Model ID merges as fallback.
- Global Default is a provider-grouped enabled-model picker, never a raw ID.
- Models support Refresh, enable/disable, and optional display aliases.
- No user-facing per-workflow model selection in v0.1; Advanced/Fast routing stays hidden.
- No required user-facing embedding or reranker provider setup. Local RAG uses Pige-managed local models.
- After BYOK setup, explicit Send transmits bounded selected context to the configured
  Provider with visible destination status and no second content-policy confirmation.
- API keys are stored in machine-local Pige app data, excluded from Vaults and default
  backups, and use OS-protected storage when Electron provides it. Settings reports only a
  safe protection state; unavailable protected credentials require reconnect.

Local RAG:

- Built-in local inference engine for embedding and retrieval support.
- Explicit, verified Pige-managed download path for the default local embedding asset.
- Local semantic and lexical retrieval indexes as rebuildable working state.
- Local reranking when a supported reranker model is installed; otherwise use hybrid scoring without exposing extra setup to the user.
- Model files are explicit cloud downloads in v0.1; manual local model import is not supported.

Local database:

- Rebuildable local working data for Library views, search, relationships, job status,
  retrieval, memory lookup, and rebuild status.
- Internal storage technology can be replaced without changing product workflows or
  durable vault data.
- Vault database is rebuildable from durable files.
- Machine-local app database is excluded from vault backups by default.

Agent memory:

- Pige-native local memory core for stable preferences, corrections, recurring workflows, and vault-maintenance lessons.
- Layered memory model from events to atoms, scenarios, and compact profile/policy.
- Inspectable memory text stored locally with rebuildable memory indexes.
- Explicit remember, undo, inspect, disable, export, delete, and reset controls.
- Secret scanning and exceptional gates for sensitive or unsafe behavior-changing memories.
- Vault-scoped Agent memory is included in backup by default, with an explicit exclude option.

Conversation history:

- Complete reference-based chat history retained as portable vault state.
- Large pasted content, source bodies, files, and saved answers are stored once and referenced from conversation events.
- Conversation history is included in backup by default, with an explicit exclude option.

Bundled toolchain:

- Core Agent helper tools are available immediately after install.
- The supported Agent, shell/runtime, PDF, and Office parser toolchain is version-pinned per release.
- Agent jobs must not attempt ad hoc dependency installation during normal capture, parsing, retrieval, or wiki maintenance.
- If a bundled tool is missing or damaged, Pige should show a repair action in Settings instead of asking the Agent to improvise.

Pi packages:

- Search and inspect Pi package catalog metadata.
- Show curated packages for knowledge management, retrieval, memory, local inference, source capture, workflow, and safety.
- Install only after explicit user confirmation.
- Show package permissions and data boundary before install.
- Support disable, uninstall, update, and version pinning.
Skills:

- Install pure Markdown Skills and external/Web Skills from URL, local `.md`, local `.zip`, or reviewed package sources.
- Chat can initiate Skill installation when the user explicitly asks.
- Stage Skill installs for preview and confirmation.
- Enable, disable, uninstall, export, and update Skills.
- Registered ordinary first-party tools use submitted-turn authority. Third-party Skills
  remain capability constrained and cannot inherit that authority.
- Show allow/deny only for the closed high-risk effects; raw-secret access is rejected
  rather than offered as a grant.

Native platform capabilities:

- macOS 26 or later: on-device voice transcription through the supported platform capability.
- macOS 26 or later: local document and text recognition through the supported platform capability.
- Windows on supported hardware/runtime combinations: local text recognition when the platform capability is available.
- Unsupported OS or hardware: an explicitly installed optional local OCR fallback.
- Windows: voice input can be unavailable in v0.1 with a clear disabled state.
- Older macOS versions: voice input can be unavailable or marked as unsupported instead of falling back to lower-accuracy APIs by default.
- Linux support is deferred from v0.1.

Backup:

- Export `.pige-backup.zip`.
- Restore from `.pige-backup.zip`.
- API keys excluded by default.
- Agent memory and conversation history included by default.

Release:

- Reproducible public-alpha release pipeline on the repository's supported release infrastructure.
- Versioned macOS 26+ arm64 ZIP with inside-out/final ad-hoc seals, immutable checksums and
  an independently downloaded quarantine report proving expected-untrusted but intact bytes.
- Manual download from the canonical protected-tag GitHub prerelease; automatic update is
  unavailable until a trusted Apple signing identity exists.
- Release notes, dependency manifest, and license notices for every release.

Safety and trust:

- Validated reversible knowledge changes auto-apply with operation history and recovery.
- Exceptional irreversible, security, destination, or conflict actions pause for intervention.
- Every Agent write operation must be logged with job ID, model profile, source IDs, and changed paths.
- External file changes must not be overwritten silently.
- No product analytics, background telemetry, or automatic crash/diagnostic upload in v0.1; support export is local, user-initiated, previewed, and redacted.
- Diagnostics, logs, crash recovery summaries, and support bundles follow `docs/DIAGNOSTICS_AND_OBSERVABILITY.md`.
- Packaged builds meet the owner-defined idle, ordinary-use, and post-heavy-Job memory
  ceilings on every declared reference platform.

### 8.2 P1 Should Have

- More advanced OCR layout recovery beyond the v0.1 baseline, including richer table reconstruction and handwriting handling.
- Richer knowledge health actions beyond the first report.
- Rich approve/reject flow for suggested links and wiki edits.
- Advanced retrieval tuning, saved ranking profiles, and larger optional local embedding or reranker models.
- Saved queries and smart collections for recurring retrieval needs.
- Compare mode for synthesizing differences across several notes or sources.
- Retrieval history so useful searches can be revisited or saved as wiki pages.
- Git-friendly change history.
- Import from an existing Obsidian vault.
- Editable managed Collections with typed fields, views, relations/formulas, and
  reversible Agent maintenance beyond the read-only v0.1 Dataset vertical.

### 8.3 P2 Later

- Cloud or device-to-device sync.
- Browser extension.
- Mobile capture.
- Remote Agent backend for Web/mobile clients.
- Mobile Lite client for capture, offline capture queue, reading, cached/metadata search, and queued remote/desktop processing.
- Audio/video transcription.
- Team vaults.
- Collaboration workflow.
- Fully open unreviewed third-party plugin marketplace.
- Advanced graph analytics and dense network visualization.
- Live external database/connectors, credentialed refresh, and explicit write-back; local
  file snapshots remain the v0.1 boundary.

## 9. Explicit Non-Goals For v0.1

- No cloud account requirement.
- No built-in paid model gateway as the only option.
- No proprietary database as the only storage layer.
- No real-time multiplayer collaboration.
- No mobile app.
- No Web app.
- No remote Agent backend.
- No automatic sync.
- No complex force-directed graph, graph analytics, or dense visual knowledge network in the first release. v0.1 may include a simple, explainable Knowledge Tree visualization.
- No unreviewed free-for-all plugin marketplace. v0.1 includes a curated Pi package manager, but community package installation must be explicit, permission-scoped, and reversible.
- No attempt to parse every file type perfectly in the first release.

## 10. Input Handling Requirements

Sections 10.0–10.7 define bounded capabilities, not a fixed workflow; section 11.1 owns
Agent selection and degraded behavior.

### 10.0 Format Ownership

Pige's accepted source kinds are a product contract, not an automatic expansion of any
bundled converter's upstream format list. The v0.1 conversion boundary is deliberately
small:

| Planned source family | Semantic or derived-content owner | Pige-owned boundary that remains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typed text, Markdown, and TXT | Pige's native text/Markdown path. | Preserve once, retain source identity, and keep untrusted-content handling. |
| Web URLs | Pige's bounded URL capture and Readability path. | Network permission, SSRF controls, inert snapshot, and source provenance. |
| PDF, DOCX, and PPTX | Bundled local AnyDoc `0.1.7` converts verified bytes to semantic Markdown/Document. | Source snapshot/CAS, PDF page locators, OpenXML preflight, relationship/media provenance, and selected local pixel OCR. |
| Images and screenshots | Pige's local OCR adapters. | Image validation, capability lifecycle, confidence, locators, and source/artifact recovery. |
| CSV, XLSX, and supported local databases | Pige's Dataset Service. | Lossless typed Dataset Bundle, no formula/macro/extension execution, bounded query, and exact data citations. |
| ZIP archives | Pige's bounded archive-inventory owner. | One archive Source/Page, no extraction, recursion, execution, or model/network work. |
| Audio and video | Preserve-and-wait source handling until the separate transcription capability exists. | No transcript, parser, model call, or network egress before that capability is available. |
| Folder and Git repository sources | No generic v0.1 capture/conversion path; future support needs its own source contract. | No recursive import, execution, network access, or implicit parser selection. |
| Unknown files | Not an accepted capture kind. | Reject rather than guessing a parser or treating the extension as authority. |

AnyDoc support for additional legacy Office, OpenDocument, RTF, EPUB, or spreadsheet
extensions does not by itself make those Pige input types. Adding one still requires an
accepted source kind, preservation and recovery contract, input limits, provenance, and—for
structured data—a Dataset contract.

### 10.1 Text

Short typed text is a conversation turn, not an automatic capture. When the user asks to
save it or Pi selects a validated capture/write tool, Pige preserves the body once as a
managed text source before compilation. Large pasted or attached bodies are preserved
as evidence before model/tool work. Without a model, source-bearing evidence stays safe
and the turn waits visibly; host heuristics do not choose capture instead.

Minimum output when text capture is selected:

- Title.
- Cleaned Markdown body.
- Summary.
- Tags.
- Entities.
- Source reference.

#### 10.1.1 Voice Input

Voice input is a capture-input convenience, not a separate audio-note feature in v0.1.

macOS requirements:

- On macOS 26+, use the highest-accuracy supported on-device speech capability, showing
  live text and keeping the final transcript editable before submission.
- First explicit start requests microphone permission; audio never reaches model providers.
- Availability/start never download. Missing Apple language resources expose one explicit
  install; completion re-probes and still requires a separate Start.

Unsupported platforms:

- On Windows, hide or disable the microphone button for v0.1.
- On older macOS versions, show an unsupported message rather than silently using older lower-accuracy APIs.

Minimum output:

- Final transcript inserted into the home composer.
- No raw audio or standalone transcript artifact in v0.1; only the user-edited composer
  text may enter the normal submission flow.
- Normal ingest flow after submission.

Platform API selection, availability probes, language assets, permissions, artifacts,
and adapter behavior are owned by `docs/I18N_DESIGN.md`,
`docs/ONBOARDING_AND_FIRST_RUN.md`, and the runtime capability contracts.

### 10.2 Markdown And Plain Text Files

Markdown and text files should be parsed locally. Markdown structure should be preserved where useful.

Minimum output:

- Source record with the selected storage strategy.
- Managed copy or verified original-file reference according to the selected v0.1
  storage outcome.
- Extracted artifact when useful.
- Normalized source summary page.
- Wiki page or wiki page updates.

### 10.3 Web Links

URL shape is evidence, not a routing decision. The submitted URL enters the same Pi
turn. Pige validates it and preserves the instruction/evidence boundary; only an
Agent-selected web tool may fetch a bounded inert snapshot, extract readable metadata,
or compile useful knowledge.

Future fallback:

- For JavaScript-heavy pages, a browser-rendered extraction path may be added.

Fetch implementation, redirects, SSRF protection, response limits, snapshots, parser
artifacts, and failure taxonomy are owned by `docs/PARSER_INGEST_SPEC.md`,
`docs/SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`, and `docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

#### 10.3.1 Skill Install Intent

Links, Markdown files, and ZIP files can also be Skill install sources, but only when the user's intent is explicit.

Examples:

- "Install this Skill: <url>"
- "把这个 Markdown 当成 Skill 安装"
- "安装这个 zip 里的 Skill"

Requirements:

- If the user intent is explicit, route the input to Skill Manager staging.
- If intent is ambiguous, Pi asks for clarification; URL or file shape cannot select installation.
- Skill installation must show a preview before enabling.
- Skill install flow must not execute code, scripts, or package install hooks.
- Files that contain executable or package-backed content must be staged with warnings and declared capabilities. They can be enabled only through a reviewed runtime adapter, Package Manager, or Local Tools flow, and sensitive runtime actions require Permission Broker mediation.

### 10.4 PDF

PDF files should be preserved as source assets without modifying the original. Bundled local
AnyDoc owns semantic PDF-to-Markdown conversion; Pige independently preserves page
references and materializes only selected visual gaps for local OCR. AnyDoc Markdown does
not replace Pige's page-locator or rendered-page provenance.

Minimum output:

- Source record.
- Managed PDF copy or original-path reference according to source storage strategy.
- Extracted text artifact.
- OCR artifact for rendered pages when embedded text is missing, sparse, or obviously poor.
- Source summary Markdown page.
- Wiki updates.

### 10.5 Word And PowerPoint

Word and PowerPoint support should be included in the first highly usable release as
best-effort local semantic conversion. Bundled local AnyDoc is the sole semantic converter
for Pige's supported `.docx` and `.pptx` source kinds: it produces the Markdown/Document
content, including supported structure, tables, speaker notes, and embedded-asset metadata.
Pige preserves source and slide/document provenance, but must not maintain a second Office
semantic parser or append separately extracted text or speaker notes to AnyDoc output.

Perfect visual fidelity is not required. Pige may materialize selected document media or
PowerPoint slide pixels only when AnyDoc's semantic output leaves a visual coverage gap for
local OCR. That materializer is an OCR bridge, not a second Office converter.

Minimum output:

- Source record.
- Managed file copy or original-path reference according to source storage strategy.
- One checksummed local semantic text artifact from AnyDoc.
- Extracted images when the source format exposes embedded image assets or a page/slide render path is available.
- OCR output from selected embedded or rendered pixels when the semantic artifact misses
  important visible text.
- Source summary Markdown page.
- Wiki updates.

### 10.6 Images, Screenshots, And OCR

Images and screenshots should be first-class capture inputs in v0.1 when a local OCR engine is available.

OCR should also act as a fallback inside document parsing:

- If a PDF page's semantic artifact has no recoverable text, render the page and OCR it.
- If a PDF page's semantic artifact has very little text but substantial visible text, add OCR as a second pass.
- If a PowerPoint slide has visual-only content that its semantic artifact does not recover,
  OCR selected embedded regions or rendered slide pixels.
- If OCR confidence is low, keep partial text but attach a warning to the source page.

Engine priority:

1. Use a supported high-quality on-device platform OCR capability when runtime probes
   prove it is ready.
2. Otherwise offer an explicit optional local OCR fallback through Local Capabilities.
3. If no OCR path is runnable, preserve the source and native extraction, expose the
   limitation, and keep the job safely resumable when the missing capability matters.

Minimum OCR output:

- Source record and source asset reference or managed copy.
- Extracted plain text.
- Page, slide, image, or region reference.
- Engine name and version.
- Confidence score where available.
- Bounding boxes or line/region geometry where available.
- Warning when OCR was partial, low confidence, or skipped.

OCR should remain local-first. v0.1 should not send images to cloud OCR providers unless the user explicitly chooses a future cloud OCR integration.

Parser-selected page routing, sparse/image-only decisions, sidecars, checksums, engine
adapters, confidence handling, bounds, tool identity, and platform-specific APIs are
owned by `docs/PARSER_INGEST_SPEC.md`, `docs/PERFORMANCE_AND_RELIABILITY.md`,
`docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/I18N_DESIGN.md`.

### 10.7 Structured Data

CSV, XLSX, and supported database files are first-class sources. Pige preserves the
original before Pi decides whether to inspect, query, summarize, or materialize a
Dataset. It MUST NOT flatten large tables into Markdown, execute workbook code, mutate
an external database, or require users to choose storage/query engines.

AnyDoc can convert CSV and Excel files to Markdown, but that output is not a replacement
for Pige's lossless, typed Dataset path and is not a v0.1 structured-data authority.

v0.1 minimum outcome:

- Lossless source preservation plus a typed, versioned Dataset Bundle.
- Read-only table inspection and bounded local query over CSV, XLSX, and supported local
  database snapshots.
- Exact Dataset revision/schema/row/range/aggregate citations in Agent answers.
- A calm table surface with schema/warning visibility; engine names stay hidden.
- Clear typed failure/manual recovery when format, formula state, size, or adapter support
  is insufficient; the original remains safe.

Editable Notion-like Collections, relations, formulas, and custom views are P1. Their
normal validated reversible changes auto-apply with Activity/Undo; original overwrite,
external database writes, destructive changes, new authority, and unreconcilable
conflicts remain exceptional.

## 11. Agent Workflows

One user submission owns one durable Agent Job. Pi may use multiple internal model turns
and registered tool calls; its final assistant message is the ordinary answer authority.
Host does not require a terminal tool, grounding label, citation count/shape, or semantic
repair follow-up. Tool inputs and durable mutations remain validated by their owners;
user cancellation, unavailable model/capability, security or authority denial,
irreconcilable conflict/drift, and malformed provider transport remain real boundaries.

### 11.1 Ingest

The ingest workflow happens when a new source enters Pige.

Required invariants and outcomes:

1. Submission creates one Pi Job; capture validation, Source Record, and managed-copy or
   verified-reference preservation are its first evidence-safety checkpoint, not another
   semantic pipeline.
2. Pi receives the durable ref, bounded metadata, and tools, then alone chooses
   inspection, extraction, OCR, retrieval, organization, analysis, and knowledge writes.
3. Parser, OCR, retrieval, and write services execute only an Agent-selected scoped tool
   and enforce limits, policy, provenance, validation, and commit fences. The writer adds
   protected metadata to Pi-authored Markdown; it never rewrites content or chooses a
   step. Repairable rejection returns to Pi; unsafe/unauthorized work blocks.
4. Output is source-backed schema-valid Markdown, citations, mechanical projections,
   Operation summary, and visible created/updated/skipped/failed/needs-attention status.
5. Eligible changes apply autonomously with Operations; exceptions use section 11.5. If the Agent, model, or required tool is
   unavailable, the preserved source remains visible and resumable; no hidden semantic
   pipeline substitutes for the Agent.

Example result:

> Processed 1 web article. Created 1 source page, updated 2 concept pages, added 5 tags, and found 3 related notes.

### 11.2 Home Query

Every Home submission is one durable Pi-owned Agent Job. Pi may answer directly, retrieve
local knowledge, call and revisit authorized tools, or ask for clarification.
Source-bearing payloads are preserved first; Host services do not select the semantic
branch, reject candidate assistant answers, or issue a semantic repair turn.

Required outcomes:

1. Ordinary questions work with an empty vault and do not require retrieval.
2. When local knowledge may help, Pi chooses scoped retrieval; deterministic ranking
   stays inside the tool and the whole vault is never sent to a model.
3. Evidence used in an answer remains inspectable and cited. No evidence means no local
   citation; only an explicit vault-only request returns insufficient evidence.
4. Valuable answers become Markdown through a validated autonomous write tool; only an
   exceptional boundary uses a proposal.
5. Home does not wait behind a spinner when safe answer text is available. It renders a
   bounded non-durable Pi draft, then atomically replaces it with Pi's authoritative final
   assistant message or clears it on cancellation or a true external block; restart
   restores durable state only.
6. Host does not validate assistant-answer semantics. Malformed Provider transport uses
   the existing call/protocol error, invalid registered-tool input stays at that tool
   boundary, and durable effect failure keeps its exact owning-service code.

Without a model, source-bearing inputs remain safe and wait for setup/resume. Any
deterministic local search fallback is explicit and never presented as Agent synthesis.

#### 11.2.1 Note-Level Agent Workflow

When a note is open, the Note Agent uses the current note as the primary context.

Required behavior:

- Current note context is always visible to the Agent.
- User can ask about the note, selected text, backlinks, sources, or related pages.
- On an explicit related-note request, the Agent reads the exact current note first, searches only
  bounded active-vault evidence derived from that note, excludes the current page, and cites returned
  related notes; neutral or quoted text does not expand scope.
- Read-only answers stay in the side panel.
- Validated reversible note edits apply with activity history and Undo.
- The Agent should cite current-note sections and linked sources where possible.

#### 11.2.2 Selection Action Workflow

When the user selects note text, Pige may show a compact action menu.

Action categories:

- Clipboard: copy, copy as quote, copy Markdown.
- Transform: translate, polish, shorten, expand, change tone.
- Understand: explain, summarize, extract key points.
- Organize: create note from selection, add backlink, add tag, turn into claim/question.
- Ask: send selection to Note Agent as context.

Mutating actions preserve version/history and auto-apply when scoped and reversible;
size alone never creates a confirmation.

### 11.3 Compile

Compile is the act of turning sources and conversations into durable wiki pages.

The Agent may:

- Create new concept pages.
- Update entity pages.
- Add claims with citations.
- Add questions.
- Add backlinks.
- Merge duplicates with recoverable Operations.
- Preserve and flag unresolved conflicts.

### 11.4 Lint

Lint is the health-check workflow.

The Agent checks:

- Orphan pages.
- Missing source references.
- Conflicting claims.
- Stale summaries.
- Duplicate topics.
- Broken links.
- Overly broad tags.
- Important uncreated concept pages.

Lint may repair eligible issues autonomously and reports every change; unsafe repairs abstain or intervene.

### 11.5 Autonomous Application And Exceptional Intervention

Auto-apply when evidence, scope, schema, base checksum, attribution, and version/trash/
rollback recovery pass—including create, update, link, rename, merge, contradiction,
hierarchy, and metadata. Otherwise replan, preserve, warn, or abstain. Only irreversible
loss, authority/security escalation, destination drift, unresolved conflict, or a stricter
user mode pauses. Activity/provenance/Undo is normal; proposals are exceptions. Raw
secrets stay unavailable. Pi may request any registered filesystem/path/commit
capability, but only active-vault recoverable knowledge Markdown and exact drop/picker
source admission are prompt-free; other scopes stay brokered, and stronger destructive,
policy, source-original, and secret gates remain.

Executable lifecycle, exceptional classes, submitted-turn authority, and policy are owned by
`docs/JOB_OPERATION_AND_RECOVERY.md`, `docs/SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`,
`docs/AGENT_RUNTIME_POLICY_CONTEXT.md`, and the shared schemas.

## 12. Markdown Page Requirements

Generated source and knowledge pages are portable, validatable Markdown with stable
identity, readable content, provenance, and relationships that remain useful outside
Pige. Root control files and managed blocks remain inspectable rather than becoming a
proprietary document format.

The executable frontmatter fields, page types, identifiers, timestamps, language,
provenance, body sections, control files, and managed-block rules are owned only by
`docs/MARKDOWN_SCHEMA.md` and the shared schemas. This PRD MUST NOT carry a second
frontmatter example or field catalog.

### 12.1 Provenance And Citations

Pige must preserve enough provenance to make generated knowledge inspectable:

- Source page links to the source record, source asset, URL, or pasted input artifact.
- Generated claims cite one or more source references.
- PDF references should keep page numbers when available.
- Web references should keep canonical URL and capture timestamp.
- Extracted text artifacts should support stable locators for generated text blocks.
- Generated pages should distinguish source-backed facts from Agent interpretation.

Citation syntax, locator grammar, machine-readable metadata, checksums, and rendering
are owned by `docs/MARKDOWN_SCHEMA.md`, `docs/PARSER_INGEST_SPEC.md`, and
`docs/CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_AND_RETRIEVAL_POLICY.md`. The Reader may render citations more
elegantly, but the stored Markdown keeps the owner-defined portable fallback.

### 12.2 Markdown Reading And Editing Experience

Markdown is not only an implementation detail. It is the main knowledge surface the user will read, search, quote, edit, and trust.

v0.1 requirements:

- Render Markdown as a polished reading surface, with a calm, artifact-like presentation rather than a raw preview pane.
- Keep generated Markdown readable both inside Pige and in external Markdown tools.
- Support common GitHub-Flavored Markdown patterns: headings, paragraphs, lists, task lists, tables, code blocks, inline code, blockquotes, links, images, and horizontal rules.
- Support Pige-specific patterns: wiki links, source citations, related-page blocks, and frontmatter-derived metadata.
- Hide YAML frontmatter by default and show it as a compact metadata header or inspectable details panel.
- Use comfortable reading width, clear heading hierarchy, generous but not wasteful spacing, accessible contrast, and stable layout.
- Code blocks should show language labels where available, copy actions, syntax highlighting if available, and safe horizontal scrolling.
- Tables should be readable, responsive, and horizontally scrollable instead of breaking the note layout.
- Images should be constrained to the reading column, support captions or source references, and never overflow the note pane.
- Selection actions must work on rendered Markdown text, not only in source-edit mode.
- Editing should preserve plain Markdown. v0.1 may start with a source editor plus rendered read/preview mode, but it must not introduce a proprietary document format.
- User edits must preserve valid frontmatter. If wiki links, source citations, or Pige-managed sections become invalid, saving should show validation errors or create a repair proposal.
- Agent-generated pages should be formatted for both human reading and future Agent maintenance.

## 13. OCR And Local Tool Requirements

OCR is a core ingest capability because real knowledge sources often contain text as
pixels. The default mode automatically chooses the best ready local capability. The
user may select a supported platform path, explicitly install an optional local
fallback, or disable OCR while preserving images and recording that OCR was skipped.

Product requirements:

- Local Capabilities shows ready, unavailable, unsupported, download-needed, disabled,
  or repair-needed state and one primary action.
- Optional downloads show size and local/cloud boundary before consent.
- Removing or changing an OCR capability never deletes source evidence or knowledge.
- OCR artifacts remain portable with the vault; binaries, runtimes, and model assets do
  not enter vault backups by default.
- Reprocessing remains explicit, provenance-linked, and non-destructive.
- Low-confidence, partial, or skipped OCR remains visible instead of becoming
  confident-looking knowledge.

Platform APIs, fallback packages, versions, language assets, presets, availability
probes, page routing, artifact metadata, rebuild behavior, and execution boundaries are
owned by `docs/PARSER_INGEST_SPEC.md`, `docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/I18N_DESIGN.md`, `docs/PERFORMANCE_AND_RELIABILITY.md`, and
`docs/RELEASE_ENGINEERING.md`.

## 14. Local RAG Requirements

RAG is an Agent capability, not a separate user-facing model-provider setup.

v0.1 local RAG requirements:

- Provide Pige-managed local embedding and optional reranking without requiring another
  provider account or API key.
- Download local model assets only with explicit user consent.
- Store model assets as machine-local data and indexes as rebuildable working state.
- Keep local retrieval usable without network after models are downloaded.
- Keep a lexical fallback available when no local embedding model is installed.
- Do not send the full vault to a cloud model for retrieval.
- Only send selected snippets and citations to the configured language model when synthesis is requested.
- Apply the context budget and citation rules from `docs/CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_AND_RETRIEVAL_POLICY.md`.
- Let users disable local semantic indexing if they want the smallest local footprint.

RAG should be invisible when healthy. The UI should expose status only when a model needs download, indexing is in progress, storage is large, or retrieval quality needs troubleshooting.

The default asset identity, download verification, runtime, dimensions, index paths,
chunking, score fusion, reranking admission, thresholds, and performance budgets are
owned by `docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/RELEASE_ENGINEERING.md`,
`docs/LOCAL_DATABASE_DESIGN.md`, `docs/CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_AND_RETRIEVAL_POLICY.md`, and
the dependency manifests.

## 15. Agent Memory Requirements

Agent Memory is a built-in Pige capability, not a required Pi package.

v0.1 memory requirements:

- Store memory locally.
- Keep memory inspectable as text.
- Separate Agent memory from wiki pages and source pages.
- Support vault-scoped memory first.
- Store global user/device memory outside the vault unless the user explicitly exports it.
- Index memory with local lexical search and, when available, the Local RAG Pack.
- Inject only compact, relevant memory into Agent prompts.
- Never inject the full memory store into the model context.
- Keep memory provenance linked to the conversation, capture, policy/exception decision, or Agent job that produced it.
- Auto-apply scoped, secret-scanned, reversible memory and let users inspect or undo it.
- Abstain or use exceptional intervention for sensitive or authority-changing memory.
- Scan memory candidates for secrets before persistence.
- Let users inspect, edit, disable, export, delete, and reset memory.

Recall policy:

- Use memory for intent interpretation, style, workflow choices, and avoiding repeated mistakes.
- Use wiki and source pages for factual answers by default.
- When memory affects an Agent action, expose a short reason such as "using your saved preference for concise summaries".
- If memory conflicts with the user's current instruction, the current instruction wins.

Memory layers, paths, schemas, provenance fields, consolidation, indexing, injection,
backup, deletion, and external research references are owned by
`docs/AGENT_MEMORY_DESIGN.md`, `docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_AND_RETRIEVAL_POLICY.md`, and the dependency registry.

## 16. Bundled Toolchain Requirements

The bundled toolchain is part of the product experience because supported workflows
must behave predictably across v0.1 platforms without making users debug dependencies.
Linux support is deferred.

v0.1 bundled toolchain requirements:

- Required Agent, parser, document, OCR-routing, and local-retrieval capabilities are
  ready after install or show one visible repair action.
- Ordinary user jobs never ask the Agent to install a missing parser, runtime, shell,
  executable, or package.
- Work that does not inherently require network remains usable offline after install,
  except for explicit optional model downloads.
- Tool removal, repair, or update never deletes durable vault data.
- The app can explain whether a capability is local, networked, optional, unavailable,
  or waiting for repair.

Exact tools, runtimes, versions, pins, checksums, licenses, source URLs, platform
packaging, and compiler choices are owned by `docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/RELEASE_ENGINEERING.md`, the dependency manifests, and repository configuration.

## 17. Skill Extension Requirements

Skill support is a v0.1 extension mechanism, but it must remain knowledge-management focused.

v0.1 Skill requirements:

- Support built-in, vault-scoped, and machine-local Skills under owner-defined storage and
  backup rules.
- Accept owner-defined local, remote, and reviewed package-provided sources only when
  the user's install intent is explicit.
- Stage and inspect the source, identity, scope, files, capabilities, data boundary, and
  warnings before enablement; staging never executes content.
- Require user confirmation before enabling a new Skill.
- Support enable, disable, uninstall, export, and update when the source supports it.
- Log when a Skill materially changes Agent behavior or output.
- Keep a closed high-risk effect blocked until its concrete user decision; do not create
  global saved modes or per-tool prompts for ordinary work.

Skill precedence:

- Current user instruction wins over Skill instructions.
- Explicit settings and `PIGE.md` win over Skill instructions.
- Privacy, package permissions, prompt-injection defenses, and confirmation gates cannot be weakened by a Skill.
- A denied high-risk effect executes nothing. A future attempt is a new concrete action,
  not a Settings grant mutation.

Exact install formats, metadata fields, scopes, files, capability vocabulary, storage,
backup, precedence, archive validation, executable escalation, and Permission Broker
mapping are owned by `docs/SKILL_EXTENSION_DESIGN.md`,
`docs/SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`, and `docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 18. Pi Package Ecosystem Requirements

Pi packages are a major extension ecosystem for Agent capabilities. Pige should support them through a curated package manager rather than ad hoc installs.

v0.1 package manager requirements:

- Show curated recommendations first.
- Keep curated recommendations limited to packages with direct personal knowledge management value.
- Support owner-defined package discovery, inspection, install, disable, uninstall,
  update, repair, version pinning, and rollback where the source makes rollback safe.
- Show identity, source, version, license, trust/disposition, health, data boundary,
  capabilities, and permission changes before install or update.
- Show capability and permission requests before install.
- Require explicit user confirmation for install and update.
- Block hidden/inferred package installation. Explicit text-only intent may run a
  registered, immutable, exact-version/integrity plan after one whole-plan confirmation;
  drift falls back to no effect, never raw Shell approval reuse.
- Route package writes through permission-scoped Pige APIs and Operations; exceptional boundaries still intervene.
- Keep package-generated durable outputs inspectable as Markdown or source artifacts when possible.

Package safety rules:

- Packages cannot receive vault-wide read or write access by default.
- Packages cannot write durable vault knowledge or control files without Pige mediation.
- Packages cannot install additional executables during a normal Agent job.
- Packages with network access must declare it.
- Packages with model access must disclose provider and data boundary.
- Package updates should show version change and permission changes before applying.

Catalog sources, metadata fields, package types, trust and health vocabularies,
knowledge-focused categories, excluded categories, install records, storage, curation,
update/pin/rollback mechanics, and current research candidates are owned by
`docs/SKILL_EXTENSION_DESIGN.md`, `docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`, and the historical
`docs/PI_PACKAGE_RESEARCH.md` where rationale is needed.

## 19. Internationalization Requirements

Pige must be internationalized from v0.1 for the six locales listed once in section
6.15 and the P0 scope ledger.

UI requirements:

- All user-facing UI strings use the owner-defined locale catalogs and formatting rules.
- Support IME composition in the home composer, search, and Markdown editing.
- Ensure compact window layouts do not overflow in German and French.
- Support CJK line breaking in note reader and editor.
- Provide Settings language selector.
- Default to system language when supported.

Content-language requirements:

- Detect or infer source language during ingest.
- Store source language in frontmatter when confidence is sufficient.
- Store language hints in OCR artifacts.
- Preserve source language by default.
- Let user configure a default knowledge language later; v0.1 can default to source/query language.
- Home query answers in query language by default.
- Generated summaries should record output language when it differs from source language.

Retrieval requirements:

- Multilingual lexical search includes a CJK-capable fallback.
- Local semantic retrieval supports the release languages when the selected local asset
  provides that capability.

OCR and speech requirements:

- Pass language hints to the active OCR capability when supported.
- Let users choose preferred OCR languages when the selected engine supports it.
- Use the selected dictation language with the active speech capability when supported.
- Voice input language is separate from app language.

Locale tags, catalog structure, message formatting, Unicode normalization, indexing,
frontmatter fields, line breaking, layout fixtures, OCR/speech adapters, and fallback
behavior are owned by `docs/I18N_DESIGN.md`, `docs/MARKDOWN_SCHEMA.md`, and
`docs/QUALITY_AND_TEST_STRATEGY.md`.

## 20. BYOK Model Requirements

Pige must support BYOK as a product requirement, not a later extension.

Models is preset-first: reviewed services fill protocol/Endpoint and ask only required
credentials; Custom alone exposes three compatible protocols plus Base URL. Connect
auto-discovers and runs one real Provider-level Pi probe before all-or-restore commit.
It does not test every model.

Each Provider owns one exact-ID inventory. Discovery/manual fallback merge; Refresh
preserves alias, enabled, and default. Global Default groups enabled models by Provider.
Targets include OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Kimi, Zhipu, MiniMax,
StepFun, SiliconFlow, CherryIn, Ollama, and LM Studio; DeepSeek is the first real proof.

Connecting and selecting a Provider Profile is the user's standing choice for ordinary,
private, and larger bounded calls to that exact destination. Setup explains once that
selected context may leave the device; routine calls then proceed without per-call
confirmation and show calm non-blocking status. Pressing Send transmits the exact
user-authored and explicitly selected bounded context without Host content classification,
redaction, rewriting, or blocking. Unknown or changed Provider/model identity requires a
new explicit user action; stored credentials stay outside payload content.

Models shows Provider connection/sync health, its unified inventory, and Global Default.
Cloud, self-hosted, and local remain internal endpoint/egress facts, not setup categories
or warning branches. Hide pricing, matrices, routing, and Advanced/Fast roles; keep
embedding/reranking in Local Capabilities. Details are owned by Pi, Settings, Tech, and UI.

## 21. Backup And Restore

v0.1 creates and restores a versioned `.pige-backup.zip`. The flow previews contents and
compatibility, detects conflicts, validates the manifest and checksums, restores into a
new folder with explicit identity handling, and rebuilds derived state.

The user-visible default is simple: include durable vault knowledge, evidence, audit,
memory, and conversation state; exclude secrets, machine-local preferences, tools,
model weights, databases, indexes, and other rebuildable state. The exact include,
exclude, identity, and compatibility matrix is owned by
[`DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`](DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md#11-backup-policy), with execution and
checkpoint behavior owned by
[`JOB_OPERATION_AND_RECOVERY.md`](JOB_OPERATION_AND_RECOVERY.md#16-backup-restore-and-migration).

## 22. Privacy And Security

Privacy promises:

- User data is local-first.
- Pige does not require a Pige cloud account for v0.1.
- User chooses model provider.
- API keys are stored only on the local machine, presented only to the configured
  provider for authentication, and never written into Markdown pages.
- API keys use Pige's fixed machine-local app-data credential store. The store is not
  portable, is excluded from default backups, and uses Electron OS-protected ciphertext
  when available; protected decrypt failure never falls back to plaintext.
- Connecting and selecting a BYOK Provider Profile authorizes ordinary, private, and
  larger bounded calls to that destination. Setup discloses the boundary once; routine
  calls use non-blocking status instead of repeated prompts. Explicit Send transmits the
  exact user-authored and explicitly selected bounded context; Pige does not classify,
  redact, rewrite, or block that content. Provider/model drift requires a new explicit
  action, stored credentials remain authentication-only, and the whole vault is never
  sent by default.
- Agent memory is inspectable, reversible, and can be disabled or reset.
- Memory candidates are scanned for secrets before persistence.
- Skill content is untrusted until installed and still cannot weaken authority, privacy settings, prompt-injection defenses, or confirmation gates.
- Skill install previews must not execute scripts, package hooks, or embedded code.
- External/Web Skills use declared capabilities and cannot inherit first-party turn
  authority. High-risk effects require the concrete confirmation; raw-secret access is
  never a capability.

Security product requirements:

- All ingested content remains untrusted data and cannot change user intent, tools,
  policy, models, paths, `PIGE.md`, permissions, or dependency state.
- One user submit authorizes registered first-party reads, parse/OCR/retrieval,
  user-specified fetch, and bounded local tools. Host validates scope/resources without
  asking after each call.
- Only sensitive effects enter permission mediation. Ask, Main-derived scoped grants, and
  explicit YOLO each record one-action authority; hard boundaries stay non-grantable.
- Optional tools and model assets require explicit download consent and verified
  admission before execution.
- External/Web Skills and packages cannot receive unmediated vault, filesystem,
  network, model, settings, destructive, or credential access.
- Suspicious source instructions are ignored and may be reported without turning normal
  capture into an alarming security console.

Secret storage, SSRF, path validation, renderer isolation, Provider send boundary, prompt
packaging, least privilege, capability scopes, high-risk vocabulary, tool verification,
and security tests are owned by `PRIVACY.md`, `docs/SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md`,
`docs/PROMPT_DESIGN.md`, `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME_POLICY_CONTEXT.md`, and the shared schemas.

### 22.1 Performance Targets

Performance budgets are product acceptance constraints, not guarantees on every machine.
The P0 ledger owns the release workload and memory commitments; exact numeric launch,
capture, query, list, indexing, parser, OCR, reader, and scale budgets are owned once by
`docs/PERFORMANCE_AND_RELIABILITY.md`.

Product-visible behavior remains mandatory: capture preservation feels immediate;
typing and reading do not visibly lag; model answers expose safe incremental progress;
long work shows progress; lexical results may
appear before slower semantic work; rebuilds remain background/resumable; and exceeding
a budget degrades visibly rather than losing data.

### 22.2 External Dependency Governance

Dependencies are explicit and traceable, but their catalog does not live in this PRD.
No Agent job may install, upgrade, or replace a dependency at task time.

Product-facing dependency rule:

> If a user-visible capability depends on an external tool, model, OS API, or provider, Pige must be able to explain its local/cloud boundary, install status, update status, and fallback behavior in Settings or inline status.

Dependency identity, sources, pins, checksums, licenses, data boundaries, update policy,
replacement paths, and admission review are owned by the Technical Architecture
registry, release contract, and machine-readable dependency manifests.

## 23. Product Acceptance Scenarios

The P0 ledger owns feature completeness. This section owns the end-to-end product
outcomes that prove those features form Pige rather than a collection of components.
Current pass/fail status and evidence remain only in the acceptance manifest.

### 23.1 Activation And Safe Capture

- A new user can create or open a visible local vault and reach the real Home composer
  without completing a product tour.
- The user can skip model setup, capture supported input, see that it is saved locally,
  reopen the app, and find the same source without duplication.
- After template auto-sync, an enabled Global Default survives restart and yields a real
  Pi/Home result or typed actionable protocol error without silent fallback.

### 23.2 Mixed-Source Knowledge Compilation

- Across the public-alpha mixed-source scenario, text, URL, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, image, and
  supported voice inputs preserve evidence before downstream work.
- The same Pi Agent control loop selects bounded source-inspection, extraction, OCR,
  retrieval, and knowledge-write tools from intermediate results; a format switch or
  service chain cannot silently choose the semantic plan in its place.
- Parser/OCR limitations produce bounded partial results, visible warnings, or a safe
  paused state rather than disappearing captures or unsupported certainty.
- Repeated sources on a related topic can update existing knowledge with citations; the
  product is not accepted if it only creates isolated source summaries.

### 23.3 Retrieval And Reuse

- Ordinary conversation works with an empty vault. Relevant personal knowledge triggers
  local retrieval with inspectable citations; irrelevant or empty results do not block
  an answer, while explicit vault-only requests report insufficient evidence.
- Retrieval remains useful through lexical fallback without local model assets and gains
  semantic capability without another provider configuration when the managed asset is
  installed.
- A user can open a result, use the Note Agent or a selection action, and save a useful
  result back into portable Markdown without losing provenance.

### 23.4 Trust, Control, And Extension Boundaries

- The user can tell where knowledge lives, when selected content may go to a configured
  cloud model, what an Agent operation changed, and whether work completed, paused,
  failed, was undone, or needs exceptional intervention.
- Routine knowledge growth completes without prompts; irreversible/security/destination/
  conflict exceptions and sensitive extension actions cannot cross their boundary.
- A Skill or curated package can complete its explicit staged lifecycle without turning
  ordinary capture into package installation or exposing a general platform console.

### 23.5 Recovery And Release Fitness

- A vault can be backed up, restored into a fresh folder, rebuilt, searched, and used
  again without losing durable knowledge, evidence, scoped memory, conversations,
  proposals, or operation history included by policy.
- Six-locale and accessibility workflows pass the release fixtures on supported
  platforms; unsupported capabilities show honest disabled or fallback states.
- A public-alpha artifact installs, reports dependency/license state, updates to the
  next compatible alpha, and preserves the vault across the update.

Quantitative thresholds, golden fixtures, unsupported-claim checks, retrieval relevance,
noise/duplicate-page evaluation, performance budgets, accessibility tests, release
scenarios, and independent review are owned by `docs/QUALITY_AND_TEST_STRATEGY.md`,
`docs/PERFORMANCE_AND_RELIABILITY.md`, `docs/MILESTONES.md`, and the acceptance
resources. Product-value research, if performed, must be opt-in and cannot introduce
default telemetry contrary to `PRIVACY.md`.

## 24. Risks

| Risk and affected promise | Detection evidence | Required mitigation and decision trigger | Primary owners |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capture, write, crash, external edit, backup, or restore loses durable evidence/knowledge or silently overwrites a newer version. | Preserve-before-work fixtures, restart/idempotency tests, external-change conflicts, source checksums, and backup/restore manifest validation. | Preserve durable input before expensive work; use recoverable writes, explicit conflicts, and validated restore. Any unexplained loss or silent overwrite blocks release. | Data Architecture, Source Storage, Job/Recovery, Sync/Migration |
| Over-created, duplicate, or weakly connected pages make the wiki noisier than the captured material. | Golden ingest/linking evaluation, noise and undo/repair evidence. | Require evidence and incremental value; auto-apply recoverable structure, abstain or intervene at exceptions, and block release on quality failure. | Knowledge Model, Prompt, Quality |
| Bad extraction or OCR creates plausible but wrong knowledge. | Multilingual parser/OCR fixtures, low-confidence and unsupported-claim checks, source-locator inspection. | Preserve native and OCR evidence separately, expose partial/low-confidence results, and prevent unsupported claims from auto-applying. | Parser Ingest, Context, Quality |
| BYOK setup or cloud use surprises or blocks users. | First-run, model-sync/default, real Provider/Pi/Home, quiet-status tests. | Preset-first auto-sync/manual fallback, one disclosure, typed repair, seamless calls, preserved waiting work. | Onboarding, Pi Integration, Privacy |
| Weak retrieval, large local assets, or slow indexing makes answers worse than simple search. | Retrieval relevance fixtures, lexical-fallback tests, disk/index/performance budgets. | Keep lexical results available, make optional assets explicit/removable, and admit reranking only when it improves the owner-defined quality/performance gate. | Context, Local Database, Performance |
| Cross-platform parsers, bundled tools, optional OCR, installer size, licensing, or security updates become fragile. | Platform smoke matrix, dependency checksums/licenses, installer and update evidence. | Keep no-download ordinary workflows, visible repair/fallback, pinned release inputs, and a replacement path. Re-scope a dependency when release gates cannot be met safely. | Tech Architecture, Release Engineering |
| Hostile sources, weak provenance, or automatic edits undermine trust. | Prompt-injection, citation, Operation/undo, conflict and security fixtures. | Treat sources as data; validate and log reversible writes; block or intervene only at the exact safety boundary. | Security, Prompt, Job/Recovery |
| Skills or packages introduce excessive permission, maintenance, or default-UI complexity. | Capability/permission negative tests, curated review, default-navigation inspection, update-delta tests. | Curate knowledge-focused defaults, isolate community search, require explicit lifecycle decisions, and block unmediated access or task-time installs. | Skill Extension, Security, UI |
| Six-locale UI or multilingual retrieval breaks compact layouts, IME, CJK search, OCR, or speech behavior. | Six-locale screenshots/workflow fixtures, IME and CJK retrieval tests. | Keep language concepts separate, use owner-defined catalogs/fallbacks, and block release when a core locale workflow is unusable. | I18N, UI, Quality |
| Desktop-local contracts make later sync/mobile/remote execution require destructive migration. | Schema/migration review, path-independent ID and capability-adapter tests. | Keep portable IDs, explicit machine bindings, conflict metadata, and runtime capability boundaries; do not implement sync inside v0.1. | Sync/Migration, Data, Future Mobile/Cloud |

## 25. Resolved v0.1 Decisions

This PRD owns product scope and user-visible behavior, not a second decision registry. The
current durable choices are indexed in [`DECISION_LOG.md`](DECISION_LOG.md); their exact
product, data, security, runtime, and release contracts live in the specialized owner
documents routed by [`START_HERE_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md`](START_HERE_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md).

When a decision changes product scope, update the relevant PRD section and the owning
contract in the same change. Do not append another resolved-decision checklist here.

### 25.1 Post-v0.1 Exploration Items

- Evaluate optional Git-backed version history after v0.1.
- Evaluate a first-class translation workspace after core capture/retrieval stabilizes.
- Evaluate signed Skill/package registry and stronger sandboxing after v0.1.
- Define future sync boundaries for Skills, memory, provider profiles, and settings profiles before building sync.
- Evaluate Remote Agent Backend as the primary post-v0.1 route for Web/mobile clients after desktop local-first v0.1 stabilizes.
